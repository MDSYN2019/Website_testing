The settings.py is where we save out the project settings. Django will only know to include our core app in the project
when we register it.

Core has the following structure:

.
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── __init__.py
├── migrations
│   └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
└── views.py

I have put the production key in an os environmental variable


views.py - A view functon, or view for short, is a python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This response can be for the HTML
contents of a web page or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document. We can create our first view.


templates - We will need a HTML template to render on a browser. Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML dynamically. The most common
            approach relies on templates. A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output.
